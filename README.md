## Introduction
This bot can do almost everything that you can do on the app, but automatically. You don't need to root your phone: it works on [uiautomator2](https://github.com/openatx/uiautomator2), which is a framework for testing apps behaviour in devices.

## Why GramAddict?
There already is [InstaPy](https://github.com/timgrossmann/InstaPy), which works on the Instagram web version. Unfortunately, Instagram bots detection system has become very suspicious of browser actions. Now InstaPy and similar scripts work at most for an hour, then Instagram blocks possibility to do any further actions, and if you continue using InstaPy, it may ban your account. 

There is also [Insomniac](https://github.com/alexal1/Insomniac/) which is the origin of this project, but there were issues that cropped up when the project organizers decided to monetize it. We wanted to keep this project completely free and open source so we forked it! Now this project is the better option. üòá [Comparison](Comparison.md) (coming soon)

Our objective is to make a completely free automation solution for Android mobile devices and emulators. Instagram can't distinguish a bot from a human when it comes to your phone. However, even a human can reach limits when using the app, so make sure you are careful with your limits. 
From version 2.0 there are a lot of limits and features you can set to avoid getting soft banned: For example, we introduced a time scheduler that will help you to set a few intervals where you want to run the bot.
Always set the total limits so you will be in the safe zone.
We also provide a config example file that you can use as a starting reference point for your account.
