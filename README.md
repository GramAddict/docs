## Introduction

This bot can do almost whaever you can do, but automatically. You don't need to root your phone: it works on [uiautomator2](https://github.com/openatx/uiautomator2), which is framework for testing apps behaviour in devices.

This is a completely free and open source project that is forked from the freemium project [Insomniac](https://github.com/alexal1/Insomniac/) when they decided to do a controversial monetization strategy. Since then we've significantly improved their codebase in many ways. We've also been adding countless new features and other improvements.

## Why GramAddict?
There already is [InstaPy](https://github.com/timgrossmann/InstaPy), which works on Instagram web version. Unfortunately, Instagram bots detection system has become very suspicious to browser actions. Now InstaPy and similar scripts work at most an hour, then Instagram blocks possibility to do any actions, and if you continue using InstaPy, it may ban your account. 

There is also [Insomniac](https://github.com/alexal1/Insomniac/) which is the origin of this project, but there were issues that cropped up when the project organizers decided to monetize it. We wanted to keep this project completely free and open source so we forked it! Now this project is the better option. üòá [Comparison](Comparison.md) (coming soon)

Our objective is to make a free solution for android mobile devices and emulators. Instagram can't distinguish bot from a human when it comes to your phone. However, even a human can reach limits when using the app, so make sure you are careful with your limits. 
From version 2.0 there are a lot of limits and features you can set to avoid to get soft banned: for example we introduced a time scheluder that will helps you to set few intervals where you want to run the bot.
Always set the total limits so you will be in a safe zone.
We also provide a config example where you can find a starting point for your account.
